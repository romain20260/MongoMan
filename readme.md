MONGOMAN is mongoclient wrapper 

the idea is to simplifie the oroginal client(official)
for execut CRUD basic easier in asynchronus

when you execute method you only care about handle the response if they are
method are async, return a promise to consumme
you can manage in your choice async/await Or .then()

you can watch the test CRUD
